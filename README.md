# Pathport
Networking docker-containers across hosts

Pathport is a network configuration tool to connect docker-containers across multi-hosts. Containners benefit from Pathport's key features:
* Overlayed logical networks supported by VXLAN/GRE.
* Totally software-defined network, i.e., your container network configurations are born to be persistent, backed up and restored.
* Scaling is easy and straitforward.
